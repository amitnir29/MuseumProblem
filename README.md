# MuseumProblem
The Museum Problem is the following problem:
Given a museum, which is a closed shaped with only right angles, how many guards are needed to protect the whole museum?

In order to solve this problem we wrote code in python which represented the museum and the needed parameters for them.

In the near future we will use an optimization package in order to solve this problem with Objective, Variables and Constraints we will define - Stay Tuned!
